Note, however, that you may not\nmisappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the\nDOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an\nopen-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in your\nsoftware, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software\nsuccess stories.\n\nThe ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for\nSoftware Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington\nUniversity, St. Louis for the development of open-source software as part of the open-source software\ncommunity. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever,\nincluding any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or\nfitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct,\nindirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including without limitation, lost\nprofits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is\nwith no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a\nparticular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice.\nWashington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no\nliability with respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC software\nor any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt\nUniversity, their employees, or students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special,\nindirect and consequential damages.\n\nDOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University,\nUC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction,\nmodification, or enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for\nDOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is\nY2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by\nCongress as \"The Energy Policy Act of 2005,\" which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules\nfor the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and\ncalendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long\nas they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.\n\nThe names ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), CoSMIC(TM), Washington University, UC Irvine, and\nVanderbilt University, may not be used to endorse or promote products or services derived from this\nsource without express written permission from Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt\nUniversity. This license grants no permission to call products or services derived from this source\nACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), or CoSMIC(TM), nor does it grant permission for the name\nWashington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University to appear in their names.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, additions, comments, or questions, please let me know.\n\nDouglas C.
