    "description": "Microsoft Reciprocal License (Ms-RL) is a permissive open-source software license that allows developers to use, modify, and distribute the licensed software without any limitations. However, if you distribute any software that includes or depends on the Ms-RL licensed code, you must also make the source code of your software available under the Ms-RL. The Ms-RL is a popular license among Microsoft's open-source projects, including the ASP.NET web framework and the IronPython programming language. The Ms-RL is based on the popular Mozilla Public License (MPL) and is compatible with other open-source licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Apache License. The license requires that any modifications to the licensed code must be released under the same license terms. Additionally, the license requires that any notices, copyrights, and trademarks must be preserved in the modified code. One of the main benefits of the Ms-RL is that it encourages community participation and collaboration by allowing developers to use, modify, and distribute the licensed code freely. The license also promotes innovation by allowing developers to build upon existing open-source software, making it easier to develop new applications and services. The Ms-RL also helps to reduce the cost of software development by providing access to high-quality open-source code. However, there are some drawbacks to using the Ms-RL. For example, the requirement to make source code available under the Ms-RL may discourage some developers from using the licensed code. This requirement can also create complications when integrating Ms-RL licensed code with proprietary code. Additionally, the license may not be suitable for some commercial applications, as the requirement to release source code may conflict with proprietary software licensing models. Overall, the Ms-RL is a permissive open-source license that promotes collaboration and innovation by allowing developers to use, modify, and distribute licensed code freely. However, the requirement to release source code under the same license terms may not be suitable for all software projects, particularly those with proprietary components. As with any software license, it is important to carefully evaluate the license terms and consult with legal counsel before using the Ms-RL in a software project.",

A \"contribution\" is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software. A \"contributor\" is any person that distributes its contribution under this license. \"Licensed patents\" are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.\n2. Grant of Rights (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create.\n(B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution in the software.\n3. Conditions and Limitations (A) Reciprocal Grants- For any file you distribute that contains code from the software (in source code or binary format), you must provide recipients the source code to that file along with a copy of this license, which license will govern that file. You may license other files that are entirely your own work and do not contain code from the software under any terms you choose.\n(B) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.\n(C) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.\n(D) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.\n(E) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.\n(F) The software is licensed \"as-is.\" You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees, or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change.
