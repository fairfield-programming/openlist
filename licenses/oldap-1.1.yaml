  ?Note: This license is derived from the "Artistic License" as distributed with
  the Perl Programming Language. Its terms are different from those of the
  "Artistic License." PREAMBLE The intent of this document is to state the
  conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder
  maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the
  package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
  the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
  reasonable modifications.?


  Definitions:


  "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
  Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
  modification.


  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or
  has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.


  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the
  package.


  "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.


  "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
  cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not
  be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing
  community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)


  "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
  there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients
  of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.
