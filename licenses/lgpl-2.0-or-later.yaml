  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.


  [This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2
  because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]


  Preamble


  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
  guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
  software is free for all its users.


  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially
  designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose
  authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
  that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
  the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
  can do these things.


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
  deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
  restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
  copies of the library, or if you modify it.


  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
  fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must
  make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a
  program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the
  recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes
  to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they
  know their rights.


  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,
  and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
  distribute and/or modify the library.


  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone
  understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is
  modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that
  what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by
  others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
  wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will
  individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program
  into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.


  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
  General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,
  the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated
  libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to
  read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
  ordinary license.


  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they
  blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program
  and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the
  library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to
  running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and
  legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the
  original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.


  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License
  for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most
  developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions
  might promote sharing better.


  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
  those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries
  themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit
  developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your
  freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are
  incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes
  in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual
  functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster
  development of free libraries.


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
  library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
  from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.


  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General
  Public License rather than by this special one.


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If
  you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
  to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
  redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under
  these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
  License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
  effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at
  least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You
  should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if
  any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
  sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
  interest in the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
  Random Hacker. signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of Vice
