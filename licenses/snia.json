If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do\nin order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You\nmust (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Storage Networking Industry Association,\"\n\"SNIA,\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that\nyour license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of\nthe license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public License.
