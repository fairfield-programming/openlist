If you do not see how to\nachieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and\n`modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\n\nDEFINITIONS===========\n\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n\n`Work' Any work being distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any\napplicable law is derived from the Work.\n\n`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example,\nthe production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion\nof such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.\n`Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in\npart. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work\naccessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's\nNetwork File System (NFS).\n\n`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly\nusable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the\nWork, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that\nmodification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the\nWork.\n\n`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such\nexplicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.\n\n`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part\nor the whole of the Work. A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not\nconsidered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies\nitself whenever it is used interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the\nWork, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a \"LaTeX-Format\".\n\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION===========================================\n\nNO WARRANTY===========\n\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder\nprovides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,\nincluding, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a\nparticular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you.\nShould the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or\ncorrection.\n\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder,\nor any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute\nand/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any\ngeneral, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or\nout of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being\nrendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to\noperate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK=======================\n\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and\nprominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be\nmaintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that is `author-maintained'.\n\nThe Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in\nthe Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by\nsupplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to\nacknowledge or act upon these error reports.\n\nThe Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current\nMaintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached\nthrough the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no\nother significant signs of active maintenance.\n\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current\nMaintainer to take over this role.\n\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the\nfollowing steps:\n\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under\nthe LPPL license.\n\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a\nprominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce\nyour new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.\n\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE======================================================\n\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are\nconsidering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in\nthis section.\n\nChoosing This License or Another License----------------------------------------\n\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly\nfrom those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for\nyour own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\n\nThe document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the\nconditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General\nPublic License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the\ndiscussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their\nworks under any license are encouraged to read it.\n\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting\nthe above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you\nhave modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that\ncould have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in\nyour best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide\nways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components.\n\nHow to Use This License-----------------------\n\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice\nincluding your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include\nalso a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the\nconditions in this license.\n\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply,\nwith the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty'\n(the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'\nreferring to any \"LaTeX-Format\", and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current\nMaintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.\n\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change \"maintained\"\nabove into \"author-maintained\". However, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as\nthe Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community\neven when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.\n\nImportant Recommendations-------------------------\n\nDefining What Constitutes the Work\n\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore\nimportant that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This\ncould, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright\nnotice of each file or by using a line such as:\n\n% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\n\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine\nwhat is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to\nmake reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.\n\n1. Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this\nlicense; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not\nrestricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.\n\n2. You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of\nonly part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such\na Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\n\n3. You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of\nthe Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in\nsuch a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it\nwould have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.\n\n4. If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work,\nthus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction,\nincluding Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this\nmanner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.\n\n5. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus\ncreating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a\nCompiled Work based on the Derived Work.\n\n6. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the\nfollowing conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly\nstates in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current\nMaintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.\n\n7. If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated\nfrom a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the\nCompiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the\nDerived Work.\n\n8. The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification,\nby any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that\ncomponent of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4,\nabove.\n\n9. Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that\nDerived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format,\ndoes not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of\napplying that process.\n\n10. \n\n11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this\nlicense place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.\n\n12. Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all\nparties with all applicable laws.\n\n1. Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the\ntwo differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search.\n\n2. If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.\n\n4. If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months\nyour intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder\nnor by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as\nthe (new) Current Maintainer.\n\n5. If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three\nmonths of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer\nmust become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their\ncommunication data within one month.\n\nCopyrightThis work may be distributed and/or modified under theconditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3of this license or (at your option) any later version.The latest version of this license is inhttp://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txtand version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeXversion 2003/12/01 or later.This work has the LPPL maintenance status \"\".Current Maintainer of this work is.This work consists of the.","type":""}
