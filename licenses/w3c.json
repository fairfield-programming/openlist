This version removes the\ncopyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by\nthe W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated\nversion of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of \"use\". Otherwise, this version is the same\nas the previous version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of\nGPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition.","type":""}
