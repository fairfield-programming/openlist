  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but modification is not allowed.


  Preamble


  The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the license under which the base
  LaTeX distribution is distributed. As described below you may use this licence
  for any software that you wish to distribute.


  It may be particularly suitable if your software is TeX related (such as a
  LaTeX package file) but it may be used for any software, even if it is
  unrelated to TeX.


  To use this license, the files of your distribution should have an explicit
  copyright notice giving your name and the year, together with a reference to
  this license.


  A typical example would be


  Given such a notice in the file, the conditions of this document would apply,
  with:


  `The Program' referring to the software `pig.sty' and `The Copyright Holder'
  referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.


  To see a real example, see the file legal.txt which carries the copyright
  notice for the base latex distribution.


  This license gives terms under which files of The Program may be distributed
  and modified. Individual files may have specific further constraints on
  modification, but no file should have restrictions on distribution other than
  those specified below.


  This is to ensure that a distributor wishing to distribute a complete
  unmodified copy of The Program need only check the conditions in this file,
  and does not need to check every file in The Program for extra restrictions.
  If you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to
  this license, instead distribute The Program under a different license. You
  may use the parts of the text of LPPL as a model for your own license, but
  your license should not directly refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the
  impression that The Program is distributed under the LPPL.


  The LaTeX Project Public License ================================ Terms And
  Conditions For Copying, Distribution And Modification
  ===============================================================


  WARRANTY ========


  There is no warranty for The Program, to the extent permitted by applicable
  law. Except when otherwise stated in writing, The Copyright Holder provides
  The Program `as is' without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
  including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and
  fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and
  performance of the program is with you. Should The Program prove defective,
  you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.


  In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The
  Copyright Holder, or any of the individual authors named in the source for The
  Program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special,
  incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of The Program or
  out of inability to use The Program (including but not limited to loss of data
  or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third
  parties as a result of a failure of The Program to operate with any other
  programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the
  possibility of such damages.


  DISTRIBUTION ============


  Redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make
  up the distribution of The Program are distributed. In particular this means
  that The Program has to be distributed including its documentation if
  documentation was part of the original distribution.


  The distribution of The Program will contain a prominent file listing all the
  files covered by this license.


  If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!


  The distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the The
  Program, and the reuse of code from The Program, are allowed under the
  following restrictions:


  The above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply
  to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the
  latest version of that file in The Program.


  ========================================================================


  NOTES =====


  We believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make
  modifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish,
  whilst maintaining the availability, integrity and reliability of The Program.
  If you do not see how to achieve your goal whilst adhering to these
  requirements then read the document cfgguide.tex in the base LaTeX
  distribution for suggestions.


  Because of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems like LaTeX,
  The LaTeX3 Project deprecates the distribution of non-standard versions of
  components of LaTeX or of generally available contributed code for them but
  such distributions are permitted under the above restrictions.


  The document modguide.tex in the base LaTeX distribution details the reasons
  for the legal requirements detailed above. Even if The Program is unrelated to
  LaTeX, the argument in modguide.tex may still apply, and should be read before
  a modified version of The Program is distributed.


  Conditions on individual files ==============================


  The individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede the
  general conditions on distribution and modification contained in this file. If
  there are any such files, the distribution of The Program will contain a
  prominent file that lists all the exceptional files.


  Typical examples of files with more restrictive modification conditions would
  be files that contain the text of copyright notices.
