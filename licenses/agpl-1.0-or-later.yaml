  AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSEVersion 1, March 2002


  Copyright © 2002 Affero Inc.510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA
  94107, USA


  This license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright
  (C) 1989, 1991 Free

  Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been
  added to cover use of

  software over a computer network.


  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is

  not allowed.


  Preamble


  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
  and change it. By

  contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your
  freedom to share and change

  free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
  Public License applies to

  most of Affero's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
  using it. (Some other

  Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)
  You can apply it to

  your programs, too.


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This
  General Public License is

  designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free
  software (and charge for

  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
  want it, that you can

  change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you
  know you can do these

  things.


  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
  deny you these rights or to

  ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain
  responsibilities for you if

  you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.


  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
  a fee, you must give the

  recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too,
  receive or can get the

  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.


  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
  offer you this license which

  gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.


  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
  everyone understands that there

  is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone
  else and passed on, we

  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that
  any problems introduced

  by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.


  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
  wish to avoid the danger that

  redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in
  effect making the

  program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
  must be licensed for

  everyone's free use or not licensed at all.


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION


  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
  placed by the copyright

  holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General
  Public License. The

  "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
  Program" means

  either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say,
  a work

  containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
  modifications and/or

  translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
  without limitation in

  the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".


  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
  you receive it, in

  any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
  copy an

  appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
  notices that

  refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
  recipients of the

  Program a copy of this License along with the Program.


  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
  thus forming a work based

  on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
  terms of Section

  1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
  Section 2) in object code

  or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
  also do one of

  the following:


  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
  expressly provided

  under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
  distribute the

  Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
  License. However,

  parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
  not have their

  licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.


  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
  However, nothing else

  grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
  works. These

  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
  modifying or

  distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
  acceptance of

  this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
  distributing or modifying

  the Program or works based on it.


  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
  the recipient

  automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
  distribute or modify the

  Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
  restrictions on

  the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
  for enforcing

  compliance by third parties to this License.


  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
  infringement or for any other

  reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether
  by court order,

  agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
  do not excuse you

  from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
  simultaneously

  your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
  as a consequence

  you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
  would not permit

  royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
  directly or

  indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
  License would be

  to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.


  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
  countries either by

  patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places
  the Program

  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
  excluding those

  countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not
  thus excluded. In

  such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
  of this

  License.


  9. Affero Inc. may publish revised and/or new versions of the Affero General
  Public License from

  time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
  version, but may

  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.


  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
  whose distribution

  conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For
  software which is

  copyrighted by Affero, Inc., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for
  this. Our decision

  will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
  derivatives of our free

  software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.


  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
  THE PROGRAM, TO THE

  EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
  THE COPYRIGHT

  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
  ANY KIND, EITHER

  EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY

  AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
  PERFORMANCE OF THE

  PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
  OF ALL NECESSARY

  SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.


  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
  ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,

  OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
  ABOVE, BE

  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES

  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO LOSS OF

  DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
  PARTIES OR A

  FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
  HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

  HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
