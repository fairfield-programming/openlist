  ?Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does
  not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons
  public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship.
  Creative Commons makes its licenses and related information available on an
  “as-is” basis. Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses,
  any material licensed under their terms and conditions, or any related
  information. Creative Commons disclaims all liability for damages resulting
  from their use to the fullest extent possible. Using Creative Commons Public
  Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
  conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original
  works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other
  rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are
  for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of
  our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended
  for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in
  ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses
  are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions
  of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure
  all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse
  the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not
  subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material
  used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for
  licensors <: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors>
  Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
  grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified
  terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any
  reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
  copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant
  only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has
  authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for
  other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the
  material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all
  changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are
  encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. <More considerations>
