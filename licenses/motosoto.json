Any Motosoto Product licensed pursuant to this License is a \"Licensed\nProduct.\" Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by Dutch copyright law. This License\nidentifies the terms under which you may use, copy, distribute or modify Licensed Product and has been\nsubmitted to the Open Software Initiative (OSI) for approval.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR\nOTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY\nSUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\nWORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,\nEVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

However,\nthis Preamble is not a part of this license. The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon\nthe terms of the License and not this Preamble. This License complies with the Open Source Definition\nand has been approved by Open Source Initiative. Software distributed under this License may be marked\nas \"OSI Certified Open Source Software.\"\n\nThis License provides that:\n\nYou may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in which case the provisions of this\nLicense will apply to your Derivative Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.\n\nAlternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other OSI-approved Open Source license,\nor under a proprietary license of your choice. If you use any license other than this License,\nhowever, you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License (including the provisions\nrelating to publishing the Source Code) for those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of\nthe Licensed Product, including the files containing Modifications.\n\nNew versions of this License may be published from time to time. You may choose to continue to use the\nlicense terms in this version of the License or those from the new version. However, only the Licensor\nhas the right to change the License terms as they apply to the Licensed Product. This License relies\non precise definitions for certain terms. Those terms are defined when they are first used, and the\ndefinitions are repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.\n\nLicense Terms\n\n1. Grant of License From Licensor.\n\na. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute Licensed Product or\nportions thereof (including Modifications as hereinafter defined), in both Source Code or\nas an executable program. \"Source Code\" means the preferred form for making\nmodifications to the Licensed Product, including all modules contained therein, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and\ninstallation of an executable program, or a list of differential comparisons against the\nSource Code of the Licensed Product.\n\nb.

Exclusions From License Grant.\n\n4. Your Obligations Regarding Distribution.\n\na. Application of This License to Your Modifications. As an express condition for your use of\nthe Licensed Product, you hereby agree that any Modifications that you create or to which\nyou contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this License\nincluding, without limitation, Section 2. Any Modifications that you create or to which\nyou contribute may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\nof this License released under Section 7. You must include a copy of this License with\nevery copy of the Modifications you distribute. You agree not to offer or impose any terms\non any Source Code or executable version of the Licensed Product or Modifications that\nalter or restrict the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights\nhereunder. However, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights\ndescribed in Section 4(e).\n\nb. Availability of Source Code. You must make available, under the terms of this License, the\nSource Code of the Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on\nthe same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the Licensed Product, or\nvia a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the\nelectronic transfer of data (an \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\"). The Source\nCode for any version of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain\navailable for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or\nat least six (6) months after a subsequent version of said Licensed Product or\nModifications has been made available. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source\nCode version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained\nby a third party.\n\nc. Description of Modifications. You must cause any Modifications that you create or to which\nyou contribute, and which you distribute, to contain a file documenting the additions,\nchanges or deletions you made to create or contribute to those Modifications, and the\ndates of any such additions, changes or deletions. You must include a prominent statement\nthat the Modifications are derived, directly or indirectly, from the Licensed Product and\ninclude the names of the Licensor and any Contributor to the Licensed Product in (i) the\nSource Code and (ii) in any notice displayed by a version of the Licensed Product you\ndistribute or in related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of\nthe Licensed Product.

If you obtain such\nknowledge after you make any Modifications available as described in Section 4(b), you\nshall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies you make available thereafter and\nshall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\nreasonably calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you that\nnew knowledge has been obtained.\n\nii. Contributor APIs. If your Modifications include an application programming interface\n(\"API\") and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably\nnecessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL\nfile.\n\niii.

If you created a\nModification, you may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice. If it is not possible\nto put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must\ninclude such Notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would\nbe likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\nLicensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the\nLicensor or any Contributor.

Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Licensed Product as an executable\nprogram under a license of your choice that may contain terms different from this License\nprovided (i) you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(e) for that\ndistribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the executable version, related\ndocumentation and collateral materials stating that the Source Code version of the\nLicensed Product is available under the terms of this License, including a description of\nhow and where you have fulfilled the obligations of Section 4(b), (iii) you retain all\nexisting copyright notices in the Licensed Product, and (iv) you make it clear that any\nterms that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor or any\nContributor.

Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n6. Application of This License.\n\n7. Versions of This License.\n\na. Version. The Motosoto Open Source License is derived from the Jabber Open Source License. All\nchanges are related to applicable law and the location of court.\n\nb. New Versions. Licensor may publish from time to time revised and/or new versions of the License.\n\nc. Effect of New Versions. Once Licensed Product has been published under a particular version\nof the License, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may\nalso choose to use such Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version of the\nLicense published by Licensor. No one other than Lic ensor has the right to modify the\nterms applicable to Licensed Product created under this License.\n\nd. Derivative Works of this License. If you create or use a modified version of this License,\nwhich you may do only in order to apply it to software that is not already a Licensed\nProduct under this License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly\nsimilar to this License, and must make it clear that your license contains terms that\ndiffer from this License. In so naming your license, you may not use any trademark of\nLicensor or any Contributor.\n\n8. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n9. Termination.\n\na. Automatic Termination Upon Breach. This license and the rights granted hereunder will\nterminate automatically if you fail to comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such\nbreach within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the\nLicensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license.\nProvisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\nLicense, shall survive.\n\nb. Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement. If you initiate litigation by asserting a\npatent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a\nContributor (Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to\nherein as \"Respondent\") alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly\ninfringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Respondent to you under\nSections 1 or 2 of this License shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice\nfrom Respondent (the \"Notice Period\") unless within that Notice Period you\neither agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for\nyour past or future use of Licensed Product made by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your\nlitigation claim with respect to Licensed Product against such Respondent. If within said\nNotice Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\nwriting by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by\nLicensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 automatically terminate at the expiration of said\nNotice Period.\n\nc. Reasonable Value of This License. If you assert a patent infringement claim against\nRespondent alleging that Licensed Product directly or indirectly infringes any patent\nwhere such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of\npatent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by said\nRespondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or\nvalue of any payment or license.\n\nd. No Retroactive Effect of Termination. In the event of termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b)\nabove, all end user license agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and reselle rs)\nthat have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to termination\nshall survive termination.\n\n10. Limitation of Liability."
