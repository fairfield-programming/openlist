(a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of\nthis License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will\nbe enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and\nintent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and\neffect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You\nfrom fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the\nenforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and\nYou must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it\nthat are in your possession or control.\n\n13.6 Dispute Resolution.
