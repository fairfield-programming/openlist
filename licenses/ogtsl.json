    "body": "The Open Group Test Suite License\n\nPreamble\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the\nCopyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,\nwhile giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less\ncustomary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nTesting is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products.\n\nFor buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments\nin applications, software and people.\n\nFor software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of\ndeveloping and maintaining multi-platform application software.\n\nFor suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs\nin check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate\nthat claim.\n\nAs such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of\nimportance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package\nand to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this\nlicense requires that the original test modes be preserved.\n\nIf you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back\ninto the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example\nthe POSIX committees).\n\nThe End\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that\ncollection of files created through textual modification.\n\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in\naccordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges,\ntime of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,\nbut only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in\nhandling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same\nconditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this\nPackage without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices\nand associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain\nor from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the\nStandard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a\nprominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided\nthat you do at least the following:\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that\nyou do at least the following:\n\n5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any\nfee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.\nHowever, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial)\nprograms as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do\nnot advertise this Package as a product of your own.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of\nthis Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to\nwhomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this\nPackage.\n\n8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\nsoftware without specific prior written permission.\n\n9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE."
