    "body": "The Clarified Artistic License\n\nPreamble\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the\nCopyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,\nwhile giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less\ncustomary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and\nderivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified\nin accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as specified below.\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n\"You\" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n\"Distribution fee\" is a fee you charge for providing a copy of this Package to another party.\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the right to use the item, though there may\nbe fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it\nunder the same conditions they received it.\n\n1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this\nPackage without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices\nand associated disclaimers.\n\n2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public\nDomain, or those made Freely Available, or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in\nsuch a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a\nprominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided\nthat you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that\nyou do at least ONE of the following:\n\n5. You may charge a distribution fee for any distribution of this Package. If you offer support for\nthis Package, you may charge any fee you choose for that support. You may not charge a license\nfee for the right to use this Package itself. You may distribute this Package in aggregate\nwith other (possibly commercial and possibly nonfree) programs as part of a larger (possibly\ncommercial and possibly nonfree) software distribution, and charge license fees for other\nparts of that software distribution, provided that you do not advertise this Package as a\nproduct of your own. If the Package includes an interpreter, You may embed this Package's\ninterpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form\nof aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so\nembedded.\n\n6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of\nthis Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to\nwhoever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.\nIf such scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called\n\"undump\" or \"unexec\" methods of producing a binary executable image, then\ndistribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor\nshall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent\nsuch an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.\n\n7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked\ninto this Package in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by\nthis Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as\nin Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any way that would\ncause it to fail the regression tests for the language.\n\n8. Aggregation of the Standard Version of the Package with a commercial distribution is always\npermitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is\nmade to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial\ndistribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.\n\n9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\nsoftware without specific prior written permission.\n\n10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nThe End"
