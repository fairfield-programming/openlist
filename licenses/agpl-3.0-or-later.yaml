  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
  document, but changing it is not allowed.


  Preamble


  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
  and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
  community in the case of network server software.


  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
  away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General
  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
  versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its
  users.


  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
  General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
  distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
  receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
  software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can
  do these things.


  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
  steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
  which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
  software.


  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made
  in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become
  available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free
  software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However,
  in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come
  about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
  letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source
  code to the public.


  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that,
  in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It
  requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
  modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public
  use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
  access to the source code of the modified version.


  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
  Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license,
  not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
  Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.


  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
  follow.


  TERMS AND CONDITIONS


  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If
  you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
  to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
  everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the
  following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of
  each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each
  file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
  notice is found. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and
  paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a
  computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users
  to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its
  interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive of the
  code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will
  be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific
  requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)
  or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
  necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU
  AGPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
